## Getting started

1. Clone the repository into your "new-project" directory

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:lfurzewaddock/js-tdd-kit.git new-project && cd new-project
   ```

2. Remove the git repository, and then initialise a new one

   ```bash
   rm -rf .git && git init
   ```

3. Remove README and replace with your own

   ```bash
   rm README.md && touch README.md
   ```

4. Update `package.json` and install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm init && npm install
   ```

   Don't forget to update the description, contact details, URL's, etc. in the `package.json` file.

5. Test configuration

Run the various commands on the sample files included. Assuming everything works as expected feel free to delete the contents of both `src` and `test` directories, excluding files `test/utils.js` and `test/jsdom.environment.js` which are used to include jsdom. See sample files for an example implementation.

## Further reading / Notes

### MS VS Code

I develop on MS Windows 10 Pro using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and my preferred editor is MS VS Code which includes an integrated terminal for tests to run on a bash CLI provided by WSL, the ability to carry out line by line debugging and extensions to add support for ESLint, Prettier and various other tools/utilities or other functionality.

Therefore, `.vscode/launch.json` is included in the project to support my environment, but is optional, so can be can be edited to suit your environment or excluded from your project, by removing the relevant comment in `.gitignore`.

MS VS Code users, should either install current release of MS VS Code extension: [WSL workspaceFolder](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lfurzewaddock.vscode-wsl-workspacefolder) or replace command reference in .vscode/launch.json

### Webpack

This project uses Webpack v4 for bundling files with npm commands suitable for both web browser and/or Node environments.

#### Babel

Webpack is set to use Babel v7 configured in `.babelrc` to transpile ES6+ to ES5. The source files under the `src` directory use ESM (ECMAScript Module) syntax and are transpiled using plugins `add-module-exports` and `transform-es2015-modules-umd` to ES5 UMD (Universal Module Definition), so they can be run in Node or a web browser.

#### ESLint

The Webpack plugin `eslint-loader` runs ESLint configured in `.eslintrc.json` and `.eslintignore` automatically on files under the `src` directory for development and production builds, but not test code and if any issues are found, will abort, reporting these issues.

### esm (ES module loader)

Tests are run directly on the ES6+ source files under the `src` directory avoiding Webpack and Babel transpilation to ES5 by using esm (ES module loader), greatly improving performance.

### Prettier

Prettier configured in `.prettierrc.json` and `.prettierignore` is integrated into ESLint and run from the command line (See lint commands above). `eslint-config-prettier` (turns off all ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier) and `eslint-plugin-prettier` (integrates Prettier rules into ESLint rules).

### JSDOM

jsdom is included for testing code that requires a Web Browser on the command line, such as DOM manipulation, to facilitate a fast, integrated TDD experience.

To avoid the antipattern of copying globals from a jsdom window onto the Node.js global object; https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/wiki/Don't-stuff-jsdom-globals-onto-the-Node-global, in the file `test/jsdom.environment.js`, jsdom is made available on the Node.js global object under the namespace: `jsTddKitLfurzewaddockComGithub` which can be invoked in a fixture setup function within tests that need it.

Currently, it is not possible to bundle jsdom with Webpack https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/2066, which is why `test/jsdom.environment.js` is written using standard ES5 CommonJS syntax, so it does not need to be included in the bundle by Webpack.

Other approaches _not encouraged by jsdom_ which add jsdom to the node process global object include:

- https://zinserjan.github.io/mocha-webpack/docs/guides/jsdom.html

Other potential ways using npm packages;

- [browser-env](https://github.com/lukechilds/browser-env)
- [window](https://github.com/lukechilds/window)
- [jsdom-global](https://github.com/rstacruz/jsdom-global)
- [shim-webpack-require-for-node-tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shim-webpack-require-for-node-tests)
